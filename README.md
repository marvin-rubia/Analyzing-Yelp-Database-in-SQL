# Querying and Analyzing the Yelp Database in SQL
This is the final assignment of _SQL for Data Science_, a course created by the University of California, Davis and offered by Coursera. 

## What is the task?
The final assignment accesses the Yelp database, within the Coursera platform, and provides a worksheet of questions that test students' SQL skills. The name of the final assignment is __Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset__.

## How to see my work?
I uploaded a .txt file to this repository. The file serves as the worksheet, which consists of questions and my SQL codes that answer them. I wrote an article to guide _anyone_ in accomplishing the assignment. I recommend that you refer to it as I added some comprehending comments about my SQL scripts and their outputs that are not found in the text file. Here is the link to my educational blog: [SQL Guide to Yelp Database (Final Assignment of “SQL for Data Science”)](https://marvinrubia.medium.com/sql-guide-to-yelp-database-final-assignment-of-sql-for-data-science-35a0a1091a07).
